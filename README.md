# Check Listia üìù
This is a simple web-based To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add tasks to a list, mark them as completed, and remove them from the list.

## Features

- Add tasks: Users can enter a task in the input box and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
- Mark as completed: By clicking on a task in the list, it can be marked as completed, and a strike-through line will be applied to the task.
- Remove tasks: Users can click on the "x" icon next to a task to remove it from the list.
- Persistent storage: The list of tasks is saved in the browser's local storage, so the tasks will be retained even if the page is refreshed or reopened.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `icon.png`, `checked.png`, `unchecked.png`).
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

6. To remove a task from the list, click on the "x" icon next to the task.
